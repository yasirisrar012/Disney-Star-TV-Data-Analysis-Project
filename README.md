# Disney Star TV Data Analysis Using Python, MySQL, Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI
A multi-stage project analyzing the Disney Star TV Network dataset, starting from data scraping and processing to building a dynamic Power BI dashboard. Here’s a breakdown of each step:
Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing Using the Pandas read_html() function, I quickly and efficiently scraped data directly from Wikipedia, avoiding the complexity of traditional web scraping tools. From there, I combined and enriched datasets, adding metrics like viewership, revenue, and broadcasting hours using NumPy to make the data more quantitative and ready for analysis.

Phase 2: SQL-Based Analysis Next, I conducted a deep analysis using MySQL, answering critical questions about channel viewership, revenue trends, language availability, and more. I queried everything from top-performing channels and subscriber trends to patterns in prime-time viewership, gaining insights that inform channel performance and strategic growth.

Phase 3: Power BI Dashboard Creation To visualize the results, I created a Power BI dashboard that brings key insights to life. The dashboard displays essential metrics, including: ✅ Average Daily Viewership by Year
✅ Revenue Breakdown by Category and Language
✅ Subscribers by Channel Category
✅ Prime-Time Broadcast Hours vs. Viewership
